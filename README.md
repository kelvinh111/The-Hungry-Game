Just a toy for learning Python & socketio based live webapp, using python flask + gevent-socketio as server, angular + sass as client.

### Prerequisites
 - Python 2.x, virtual env
 - ruby sass & compass

 1. install python requirements to virtual env
 2. run gulp if you wanna use scss, with watch & auto compile (and also browser-sync!)
 3. edit codes ie. modify shops list & game start time in hungry.py
 4. python run_server.py

### What's next
 - rooms (and topic)
 - DB (managing settings & data)
 - user acc 
 - admin page (cancel room, kick someone out, etc.)
 - redesign
 - better timer mechanism
 - refactor
